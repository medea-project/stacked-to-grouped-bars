Switch between stacked and grouped layouts using sequenced transitions! Animations preserve object constancy and allow the user to follow the data across views. Animation design by [Heer and Robertson](http://vis.berkeley.edu/papers/animated_transitions/). Colors and data generation inspired by [Byron and Wattenberg](http://www.leebyron.com/else/streamgraph/).
